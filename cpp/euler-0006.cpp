/*
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 
 * 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 == 385
 *
 * the square of the sun of the first ten natural numbers is, 
 * (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
 *
 * Hence the difference between the sun of the squares of the first ten natural 
 * numbers and the square of their sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640 
 *
 * Find the difference between the sun of the squares of the first one hundred 
 * natural numbers and the square of the sum
